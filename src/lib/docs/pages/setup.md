# Setup

Setting up the server is relatively simple!
Download the appropiate binaries from [here](https://github.com/cyteon/mist/releases). And run them!

Your server will now be running on 0.0.0.0:25565, and you can conect to it from minecraft. On startup the server will create `config.toml`, `world/` and `logs/`.
